Simple Star Simulation - Phys375

The final project for uwaterloo course phys375 (Astrophysics 2: Stars).  We had to construct a (simple) simulation of stars using the course material.  Method used was the 'shooting method.'  For a given central temperature the code bisects over central densities until it has found an acceptable error tolerance.  We can (with simplified odes) solve for outer temperature, luminosity, etc., if we have the central temperature and central density.
